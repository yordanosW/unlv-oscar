## Tips

- Simplify! Only build a smaller portion of the website
- Simplify! Use lorem ipsum and other placeholders so you can focus on layout
- Simplify! Match the colors and fonts as close as you can but don't worry about an exact match
- Don't get lost in the details - there might be margins/proportions that are slightly off, it's ok! It is just practice, close enough is good enough for now. Move to the next layout challenge
- Don't worry about fancy stuff - there are social icons, it's ok to just put a div or a span tag there for now. For bonus, you can go back and put in the social tags
- Check the images! - some parts of the website have been made into images so that it is easier for you to incorporate. The goal is practicing the fundamentals as best as you can, not getting everything 100% perfect.
